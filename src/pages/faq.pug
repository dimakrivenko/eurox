										h4 How does Eurox work?
										i
									.text
										p.
											Euroxs exists on blockchains through the Omni Protocol. The
											Omni Protocol is open source software that interfaces with 
											blockchains to allow for the issuance and redemption of
											cryptocurrency tokens, in our case, “Euroxs”. Eurox Platform 
											currencies are 100% backed by actual fiat currency assets in 
											our reserve account. Euroxs are redeemable and exchangeable 
											pursuant to Eurox Limited’s terms of service. The conversion 
											rate is 1 Eurox USD₮ equals 1 USD. The Eurox Platform is fully
											reserved when the sum of all Euroxs in circulation is greater
											than or equal to the balance of fiat currency held in our reserve.
											Through our Transparency page, anyone can view both of these
											numbers in near real-time. For a more detailed technical 
											explanation of how the Eurox Platform works, please 
											download the <a href="#" target="_blank">Eurox white paper.</a>
