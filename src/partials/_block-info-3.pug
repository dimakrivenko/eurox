                    Eurox is supported by the Proof of Reserve process. 
                    This process  is fundamental to maintaining the priceÂ­ 
                    parity between Eurox in circulation and the underlying 
                    fiat currency held in reserves. 
                li.
                    This system ensures that at any given time the balance of
                    fiat currency held in reserve will be equal to (or greater than) 
                    the number of Eurox in circulation.
                li.
                    Simple but effective approach for conducting Proof of Reserves 
                    significantly reduces our counterparty risk as the custodian of 
                    the reserve assets.
